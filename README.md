<h1>How do I approach designing software?</h1>
<br>
It's important when first approaching designing software to have a concept or plan of the software goals and the necessities to complete those goal(s). Without having a set goal but also revising the process of reaching that said goal would be good practice for software designing. It also takes a lot of trial and error which can be summarized as having an open-mind to not getting something right every time and to build to fixing that problem and to get it right.

<h1>How do I approach developing programs?</h1>
<br>
When developing programs, utilizing iteration techniques would be useful in other projects but for this class, I found that taking shortcuts would've made my code disorganized even with comments and syntax to aid me. Creating my final project required me to draw multiple meshes and manipulate them to create a 3D space based on a reference picture. Depending on the scale of the reference, the code can take hundreds of lines and with the amount of detail, even more. Thus, for this project, it was extremely important to keep my code organized and to utilize iteration for each mesh and draw those meshes.
<h1>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</h1>
<br>
Computer science can help me reach my goals of utilizing my skills in the workplace but also reinforce new knowledge that I can use in my passion projects to innovate new ideas and advance my current knowledge of what I learned throughout this course and in future courses.
